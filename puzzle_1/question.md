(Problem from LeetCode)

Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers (with digits stored in reverse order, and each node containing a single digit), add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume that the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

- Input:
l1 = [2, 3, 4]
l2 = [5, 6, 4]

- Output:
[7, 0, 8]

Explanation:
342 + 465 = 807
